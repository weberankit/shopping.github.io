# shopping cart
<h2>Hello, everyone! I'm excited to introduce my custom-built shopping cart website, which I've developed from the ground up using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project holds a<b> special place as one of my initial ventures into web development</b>. While it has some room for improvement, such as its folder structure, I've made significant enhancements in my subsequent React projects. Here are some key features of my project:</h2>

<h2>Framework and Library Independence:</h2> My project is designed to be framework and library independent. This means that it doesn't rely on any specific external tools or technologies, making it lightweight and versatile.

<h2>Wishlist Functionality:</h2> Users can easily add or remove items from their wishlist. This feature allows shoppers to save items they're interested in for future reference.

<h2>Cart Management:</h2> I've implemented robust cart management capabilities. Users can directly add items to their cart, making the shopping experience seamless and efficient.

<h2>Large Size Item Viewing:</h2> For a better shopping experience, users can view items in larger sizes. This feature enables customers to examine product details with clarity.

<h2>Scrollable Item Images:</h2> I've incorporated the ability to scroll through item images. This feature is particularly useful for products that have multiple images, allowing customers to get a comprehensive view.

<h2>User Authentication:</h2> To enhance user experience, my project includes a login and logout system that uses local storage

I've put in a lot of effort to make this shopping cart website as functional and user-friendly as possible, given its status as one of my initial projects. While it may have some structural quirks,  I hope you enjoy exploring it, and I'm open to any feedback or suggestions for improvement.
